                        <p>In very dog friendly cities, such as Los Angeles, numerous dog daycares and hotels have opened in recent years, but there is currently no centralized place to search for them. Additionally, many daycares do not list prices or availability online, and few offer online payment.</p>

After the first round of user testing I found users were able to sign up and search for a location with ease, but were confused by the booking process. The original process attempted to gather too much information on a single screen and if a user missed a section they could not figure out how to complete the process.</p>

                        <h2>User Testing</h2>
                        <p>I simplified the process by having the user select which service they were booking before moving to the reservation screen, and I modeled the booking calendar after the booking process on many airline apps, which the target users are familiar with. I then created a second user test for just this task with the same set of users. With this change the users were able to complete the booking process without confusion.</p>

                        <p>I applied the branding to the wireframes for the final mock-ups. I focused most of the color use to the onboarding screens to draw users in and kept it limited within the app to emphasize navigation and CTAs. I included some dog sketches (created by Freepik) throughout the app to keep up the sense of playfulness.</p>

                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>This project taught me a lot about working within the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and how straying from commonly used elements can affect usability. I had made the assumption that users would work from the top of the screen down when making a reservation, but because the calendar was such a prominent and familiar element it was where the majority of the users focused first. Because the calendar wouldnâ€™t work until the service type was selected it threw off the flow and users got stuck. Fixing that element so users could select dates on the calendar at any point during the resrvation process solved the usability issues.</p>
